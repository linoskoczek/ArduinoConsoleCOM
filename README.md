# ArduinoConsoleCOM
Application which can be used to transfer data from Arduino to your computer using communication port. It's very similar to the COM console that can be found in Arduino IDE.

## Requirements
- Arduino
- Java 8 or higher
- installed [RXTX library](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download)

Application was tested under GNU/Linux only.

## How to start

Compile and run Main.class

## What will happen

Application will look for a port which allows you to communication with Arduino. If there are none, an error box will appear.
Otherwise, you will be given a choice about which port to use.

Afterwards, the console shows up and you are ready to go.
